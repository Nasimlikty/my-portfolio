                “If you're already a front-end developer, well, pretend you're also wearing a pirate hat.”
                ― Ethan Marcotte,“A successful website does three things:
                It attracts the right kinds of visitors.
                Guides them to the main services or product you offer.
                Collect Contact details for future ongoing relation.”

                <p>I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                    efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called
                    Vue
                    JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.</p>

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>

                <p>“Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better
                    idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the
                    Universe is winning.”
                    ― Rick Cook.</p>
